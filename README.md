# Gibbs-Phenomenon
A python Implementation of the Gibbs Phenomenon by Fourier series. The project uses midpoint rule for the numerical integration approximation.
The following function are available:
1. $x^2$
2. Sawtooth Function
3. Square wave
4. Traingular wave


These all functions are not simultaneously used, hence one need to change the program at appropriate places.
